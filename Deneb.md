> **Deneb** is a blue supergiant star in the constellation of Cygnus. 
> It is the brightest star in the constellation and the 19th brightest in the night sky, 
> with an apparent magnitude slightly varying between +1.21 and +1.29. 
> Deneb is one of the vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle 
> and the "head" of the Northern Cross. 
> Its Bayer designation is α Cygni, which is Latinised to Alpha Cygni, abbreviated to Alpha Cyg or α Cyg. 
>
> Deneb rivals Rigel, a closer blue supergiant, as the most luminous first-magnitude star. 
> However, its distance, and hence luminosity, is poorly known; 
> its luminosity is estimated to be between 55,000 and 196,000 times that of the Sun. 
> Distance estimates range from 1,400 to 2,600 light-years; 
> assuming its highest value, it is the farthest star with an apparent magnitude brighter than 2.50.
