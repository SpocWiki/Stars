> **Vega** is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Lyra. 
> It has the Bayer designation α Lyrae, which is Latinised to Alpha Lyrae 
> and abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr. 
> 
> This star is relatively close at only 25 light-years (7.7 parsecs) from the Sun, 
> and one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood, 
> being intrinsically brighter than any star nearer to the sun. 
> 
> It is the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, 
> and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.
>
> Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed 
> "arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun". 
> 
> Vega was the northern pole star around 12000 BCE 
> and will be so again around the year 13724, when its declination will be +84° 14′, 
> less than six degrees from the Pole. 
> 
> Vega was the first star other than the Sun to have its image and spectrum photographed. 
> It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. 
> Vega has functioned as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale 
> and was one of the stars used to define the zero point for the UBV photometric system.
>
> Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun, but since it is 2.1 times as massive, 
> its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun; 
> both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their main sequence lifetimes. 
> 
> Compared with the Sun, Vega has a lower abundance of elements heavier than helium. 
> Vega is also a variable star—that is, a star whose brightness fluctuates. 
> It is rotating rapidly with a speed of 236 km/s at the equator. 
> This causes the equator to bulge outward due to centrifugal effects, and, 
> as a result, there is a variation of temperature across the star's photosphere 
> that reaches a maximum at the poles. 
> 
> From Earth, Vega is observed from the direction of one of these poles.
>
> Based on observations of more infrared radiation than expected, 
> Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust. 
> 
> This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, 
> which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. 
> 
> Stars that display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars. 
> 
> Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope show that 
> the disk is exceptionally smooth, with no evidence of shaping by massive planets, 
> though there is some evidence that there may be one or more Neptune-mass planets closer to the star.
